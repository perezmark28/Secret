# For My Love

A personal romantic website. Deploy to Railway:

1. Push this folder to a GitHub repo.
2. In [Railway](https://railway.com), click **New Project** → **Deploy from GitHub** and select the repo.
3. Railway will run `npm install` and `npm start` (serves the site with `serve`).
4. Add a **Public Domain** in the project settings to get a URL like `your-app.up.railway.app`.

No environment variables required. Open the generated URL and you’ll see the landing page (PIN: 010125 to enter).
