          <p class="message-body">Happy Valentine’s Day. Before anything else, I just want you to know how deeply grateful I am for you. From the moment you became part of my life, everything began to feel more meaningful. You have a way of turning ordinary moments into something special, simply by being you. Loving you has been one of the best things that has ever happened to me, and every day with you reminds me how lucky I am to call you mine.</p>
          <p class="message-body">Thank you for choosing me every day, even on the hard days. Thank you for believing in me, supporting me, and loving me in ways that feel genuine and real. Being with you has taught me what love truly is—not just the big romantic moments, but the quiet ones too: the conversations, the shared silence, the comfort of knowing we’re in this together.</p>
          <p class="message-body">I promise to keep loving you with intention, to protect your heart, to listen, and to always make space for you in my life. I promise to stand beside you through whatever comes our way—celebrating your wins, holding you through the tough times, and building a future filled with trust, laughter, and love.</p>
          <p class="message-body">You are my safe place, my happiness, and my favorite part of every day. No matter where life takes us, my heart is yours. Today, tomorrow, and always.</p>
          <p class="message-closing">Happy Valentine’s Day, My Boo. ❤️</p>
